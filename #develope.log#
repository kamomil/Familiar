Today and yesterday I was trying to add jquery and dioctionary to my app.
at first I used ajax in jquery in order to call morfix and got a GET error when trying to download some picture. 
I decided it's too MESURBAL and I end up using webster dictionary api. 
At first I tried to use the php script they provided and couldn't make it work.
I then use direct URL.

I tryed the code:

//------------------------------

def = jdata.find('dt');
def[0].text();          //this doesn't work because def[0] is of type "element" and not jQuery
//------------------------------
I keeped getting the bug:

Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Element> has no method 'text'

The I realyse the code should be:

//------------------------------

def = jdata.find('dt');
$(def[0]).text();      //$() make a jQuery object from the Element object
//------------------------------
 
if(def instanceof jQuery){//yofi it is
   alert("yofi!");
}
alert(def[0].constructor.name);//element type

If the word has only one entry and is "past tense of X"
	I create a word object for X
If the word has two enteries where one is "past tense of X" 
	I create two objects , one of the word and the other of X and I put the context in both of them.

had a bug : added this to the manifst:

 "content_scripts": [ 
  {
	"matches": ["http://*/*","https://*/*"],
	"js": ["show_contexts_jquery.js"]
  }],


This cause show_context to fire every page.

Also, read that javascript is not multithredead so cool. 

added listener in the backgroud file to when the pop send ready message,
the listener remove itself in the end, cause we need only one listener.

TODO:
 - add links to the context,
 - add css
 - add option to save the localstorge as xml and send it as mail.
